her first husband had died[anki:play:q:0]	o primeiro marido dela tinha morrido

They lived on a remote farm in the west of England[anki:play:q:0]	Eles moravam em uma remota fazenda no oeste da Inglaterra
and what a pair of fools they were![anki:play:q:0]	e que par de tolos eles eram!

In those days, there also lived an old soldier called Jack Hannaford.[anki:play:q:0]	Naqueles dias, existia (vivia) também um velho soldado chamado Jack Hannaford.
His coat was old and he was poor [anki:play:q:0]	Seu casaco era velho e ele era pobre

He was sly like a fox.[anki:play:q:0]	Ele era astuto/malicioso como uma raposa.
When he left the army[anki:play:q:0]	Quando ele deixou o exército
he walked all around the country[anki:play:q:0]	ele caminhou por todo o país
looking for ways to play his tricks [anki:play:q:0]	procurando por maneiras de “jogar seus truques” (fazer suas artimanhas).
After he had traveled for some time[anki:play:q:0]	Depois que ele tinha viajado por algum tempo
he came across the farm belonging to the pair.[anki:play:q:0]	ele deu de cara com a fazenda que pertencia ao par (ao casal).
He knocked on the door of the house,[anki:play:q:0]	Ele bateu na porta da casa
and a moment later, the wife answered [anki:play:q:0]	e “um momento depois” (pouco depois) a esposa respondeu.
She looked him up and down, quite astonished[anki:play:q:0]	Ela olhou ele de cima a baixo, muito surpresa
because few strangers were able to make the difficult journey to their home[anki:play:q:0]	porque poucos desconhecidos eram capazes de fazer a difícil jornada até a casa deles.
Where did you come from?” she asked [anki:play:q:0]	“De onde você veio?”, ela perguntou.
Jack looked up at the pale blue sky[anki:play:q:0]	Jack olhou para o céu azul claro
and he said, “I came from Heaven.”[anki:play:q:0]	e ele disse, “eu vim do céu”.
“My goodness!”, she said.[anki:play:q:0]	“Meu Deus!”, ela disse.
“Did you see my husband there?”[anki:play:q:0]	“Você viu meu marido lá?”
The farmer’s wife was talking about her first husband[anki:play:q:0]	A esposa do fazendeiro estava falando sobre o primeiro marido dela,
the man who had died[anki:play:q:0]	o homem que tinha morrido
“Oh yes, I got to know him well[anki:play:q:0]	“Ah sim, eu conheci ele bem
when I was staying in Heaven,” said Jack.[anki:play:q:0]	quando eu estava ficando/passando um tempo no céu”, disse Jack.
“And how is he doing?”, asked the woman.[anki:play:q:0]	“E como ele está?”, perguntou a mulher.
He is fine,” replied the old soldier.[anki:play:q:0]	“Ele está bem”, respondeu o velho soldado.
He works hard sewing and mending clothes for the saints and angels [anki:play:q:0]	Ele trabalha duro costurando e remendando roupas para as santidades e os anjos
but even so, he sometimes doesn’t have enough money to eat.[anki:play:q:0]	mas mesmo assim, ele às vezes não tem dinheiro o suficiente para comer.
“And did he send me a message?”, she asked.[anki:play:q:0]	“E ele me mandou uma mensagem?”, ela perguntou.
Yes, he did![anki:play:q:0]	Sim, ele mandou!
That is why I’ve come here.[anki:play:q:0]	É por isso que eu vim aqui.
He asked me to bring back some money for him,[anki:play:q:0]	Ele me pediu para trazer de volta um pouco de dinheiro para ele,
so that he can spend his days in paradise more comfortably.[anki:play:q:0]	para que/de modo que ele possa passar seus dias no paraíso mais confortavelmente.
On hearing this, the poor woman’s heart almost broke with pity.[anki:play:q:0]	Ao ouvir isso, o coração da pobre mulher quase quebrou com/de piedade.
I’ll give him anything he wants![anki:play:q:0]	Eu vou dar a ele qualquer coisa que ele quiser!
“He’s a good man, God bless him,” she said.[anki:play:q:0]	“Ele é um bom homem, Deus o abençoe”, ela disse.
Then she went to the chimney[anki:play:q:0]	Então ela foi até a chaminé
where the couple’s savings were kept hidden.[anki:play:q:0]	onde as economias do casal eram mantidas (ficavam) escondidas.
She took out two pieces of gold and five pieces of silver,[anki:play:q:0]	Ela pegou/retirou duas moedas de ouro e cinco moedas de prata,
which in those days was a lot of money.[anki:play:q:0]	o que naqueles dias era muito dinheiro.
She handed everything over to the old soldier[anki:play:q:0]	Ela entregou tudo para o velho soldado
and told him to hurry up and give it to her first husband.[anki:play:q:0]	e falou para ele se apressar e dar (isso) para seu primeiro marido.
“I will,” Jack told the woman,[anki:play:q:0]	“Eu vou”, Jack falou para a mulher,
“as soon as I return to Heaven.”[anki:play:q:0]	"""assim que eu retornar ao céu”."
When the farmer came back,[anki:play:q:0]	Quando o fazendeiro voltou
his wife told him all about how a messenger had come from Heaven.[anki:play:q:0]	a esposa dele contou para ele tudo sobre como um mensageiro tinha vindo do céu.
She said that the man asked for money for her first husband,[anki:play:q:0]	Ela disse que o homem pediu dinheiro para seu primeiro marido,
who was living and working in Heaven, but who was poor.[anki:play:q:0]	que estava vivendo (morando) e trabalhando no céu, mas que era pobre.
“You are a foolish woman!” shouted the farmer.[anki:play:q:0]	“Você é uma mulher tola!”, gritou o fazendeiro.
“How could you believe such a silly story?”[anki:play:q:0]	“Como você pôde acreditar em uma história tão boba?”
“Well, you are even more foolish,” said the woman,[anki:play:q:0]	“Bom, você é ainda mais tolo”, disse a mulher.
“because you showed me where the money was hidden.”[anki:play:q:0]	“porque você me mostrou onde o dinheiro estava escondido.”
The husband did not agree with what she said,[anki:play:q:0]	O marido não concordou com o que ela disse,
but he did not stay to argue.[anki:play:q:0]	mas ele não ficou para discutir.
He hurried off on his horse to try to find the old soldier[anki:play:q:0]	Ele partiu às pressas em seu cavalo para tentar encontrar o velho soldado
before he got too far away.[anki:play:q:0]	antes que ele chegasse/ficasse muito longe.
Jack Hannaford heard the sound of the horse behind him.[anki:play:q:0]	Jack Hannaford ouviu o som do cavalo atrás dele.
He knew that the farmer was coming for him and for the money.[anki:play:q:0]	Ele sabia que o fazendeiro estava vindo atrás dele e do dinheiro.
Quickly, he came up with a plan.[anki:play:q:0]	Rapidamente, ele inventou (“bolou”) um plano.
He knelt by the side of the road,[anki:play:q:0]	Ele ajoelhou-se ao lado da estrada,
covered his eyes with one hand,[anki:play:q:0]	cobriu seus olhos com uma mão,
and pointed up to the sky with the other.[anki:play:q:0]	e apontou para o céu com a outra.
The farmer soon reached him and asked:[anki:play:q:0]	O fazendeiro logo o alcançou e perguntou:
"""What are you doing here by the side of the road?""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""O que você está fazendo aqui ao lado da estrada?"""
“Why are you protecting your eyes”[anki:play:q:0]	“Por que você está protegendo os seus olhos”
"""and pointing up to the sky?""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""e apontando para o céu?"""
“It is amazing! It is God’s work!” shouted the man.[anki:play:q:0]	“É incrível! É uma obra de Deus!”, gritou o homem.
“I see a wonderful thing!”[anki:play:q:0]	“Eu vejo uma coisa maravilhosa!”
“What kind of wonderful thing?” asked the farmer.[anki:play:q:0]	“Que tipo de coisa maravilhosa?”, perguntou o fazendeiro.
“A man is walking straight up to Heaven on a rainbow,”[anki:play:q:0]	“Um homem está andando diretamente para o céu em um arco-íris”,
"""just as if it were a road.""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""exatamente como se fosse uma estrada."""
The farmer looked at the sky,[anki:play:q:0]	O fazendeiro olhou para o céu,
but he could not see the amazing rainbow[anki:play:q:0]	mas ele não conseguiu ver o incrível arco-íris
or the man walking on it.[anki:play:q:0]	ou o homem andando sobre ele.
“Here,” said the soldier,[anki:play:q:0]	“Aqui,”, disse o soldado,
“kneel down by the side of the road”[anki:play:q:0]	“ajoelhe-se ao lado da estrada”
“and look up at the sky like I’m doing.”[anki:play:q:0]	“e olhe para o céu como eu estou fazendo.”
"""I will if you’ll hold my horse,"" said the farmer,[anki:play:q:0]"	"""Eu vou se você segurar meu cavalo"", disse o fazendeiro,"
and he jumped down from his horse.[anki:play:q:0]	e ele pulou do seu cavalo.
As soon as the farmer knelt down,[anki:play:q:0]	Logo que o fazendeiro ajoelhou-se,
Jack Hannaford jumped onto the horse and escaped![anki:play:q:0]	Jack Hannaford pulou no cavalo e escapou!
Now, who do you think was more foolish, the farmer or his wife?[anki:play:q:0]	Agora, quem você acha que foi mais tolo, o fazendeiro ou sua esposa?
In the Far East there was a Great King[anki:play:q:0]	No Extremo Oriente havia um Grande Rei
who had no work to do.[anki:play:q:0]	que não tinha nenhum trabalho para fazer.
Every day, and all day long,[anki:play:q:0]	Todos os dias, e o dia todo,
he sat on soft cushions and listened to stories.[anki:play:q:0]	ele se sentava em almofadas macias e escutava histórias.
And no matter what the story was about,[anki:play:q:0]	E não importa sobre o que era a história,
he never grew tired of hearing it,[anki:play:q:0]	ele nunca se cansava de escutá-la,
even though many of the stories took hours to complete.[anki:play:q:0]	mesmo que muitas histórias levassem horas para acabar.
“There is only one fault with your story,” he often said,[anki:play:q:0]	“Há apenas uma falha na sua história,” ele frequentemente dizia,
“it is too short.”[anki:play:q:0]	“ela é muito curta.”
All the storytellers in the world were invited to his palace;[anki:play:q:0]	Todos os contadores de histórias do mundo eram convidados ao seu palácio;
and some of them told stories that were very long indeed.[anki:play:q:0]	e alguns deles contavam histórias que eram realmente muito longas.
But The King was always sad[anki:play:q:0]	Mas o Rei estava sempre triste
when the story ended.[anki:play:q:0]	quando a história acabava.
At last he sent a message to every city and town,[anki:play:q:0]	Finalmente ele enviou uma mensagem a toda cidade grande e cidade pequena,
offering a prize to any one able to tell him an endless tale.[anki:play:q:0]	oferecendo um prêmio a qualquer um capaz de contar a ele um conto sem fim.
He said: “To the man that will tell me a story which lasts forever,[anki:play:q:0]	Ele disse: “Ao homem que irá me contar uma história que dure para sempre,
I will give my daughter as his wife;[anki:play:q:0]	Eu darei minha filha como sua esposa;
and I will make him my heir,[anki:play:q:0]	e eu farei dele meu herdeiro,
"and he shall be king after me.""[anki:play:q:0]"	"e ele será rei depois de mim."""
But this challenge wasn’t quite what it seemed.[anki:play:q:0]	Mas este desafio não era muito (exatamente) o que parecia.
The King added a strict condition.[anki:play:q:0]	O Rei adicionou uma condição rigorosa.
“If any man tries to tell such a story and fails,[anki:play:q:0]	“Se qualquer homem tentar contar tal história e falhar,
then his head will be cut off.”[anki:play:q:0]	então sua cabeça será cortada.”
The King's daughter was very beautiful,[anki:play:q:0]	A filha do Rei era muito bonita,
and many young men in The Kingdom[anki:play:q:0]	e muitos jovens rapazes no Reino
were willing to do anything to win her.[anki:play:q:0]	estavam dispostos a fazer qualquer coisa para ganhá-la.
But none of them wanted to lose his head,[anki:play:q:0]	Mas nenhum deles queria perder a cabeça,
and so only a few tried for the prize.[anki:play:q:0]	e então apenas alguns se arriscaram pelo prêmio.
One young man invented a story that lasted three months;[anki:play:q:0]	Um jovem rapaz inventou uma história que durou três meses;
but after that, he could think of nothing more.[anki:play:q:0]	mas depois disso, ele não conseguiu pensar em mais nada.
His fate was a warning to others,[anki:play:q:0]	Seu destino foi um alerta aos outros,
and it was a long time before another storyteller[anki:play:q:0]	e levou muito tempo antes que outro contador de histórias
was daring enough to take the King's challenge.[anki:play:q:0]	fosse ousado o suficiente para aceitar o desafio do Rei.
One day a Stranger from the South came to The Palace.[anki:play:q:0]	Um dia um Estranho do Sul veio ao Palácio.
"""Great king,"" he said,[anki:play:q:0]"	"""Grande rei,"" ele disse,"
"""is it true that you offer a prize""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""é verdade que você oferece um prêmio"""
"""to the man who can tell a story that has no end?""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""ao homem que conseguir contar uma história que não tem fim?"""
"""It is true,"" said The King.[anki:play:q:0]"	"""É verdade,"" disse o Rei.`"
"""And will this man have your daughter for his wife,""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""E irá este homem ter sua filha como esposa,"""
"""and will he be your heir?""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""e será ele (irá ele ser) seu herdeiro?"""
"""Yes, if he succeeds,"" said The King,[anki:play:q:0]"	"""Sim, se ele for bem-sucedido,"" disse o Rei,"
"""but if he fails, he will lose his head.""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""mas se ele falhar, ele vai perder sua cabeça."""
"""Very well, then,"" said the Stranger.[anki:play:q:0]"	"""Muito bem, então,"" disse o Estranho."
"""I have a pleasant story about locusts.""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""Eu tenho uma agradável história sobre gafanhotos."""
"""Tell it,"" said The King.[anki:play:q:0]"	"""Conte-a,"" disse o Rei."
"""I will listen to you.""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""Eu vou te escutar."""
The storyteller began his story.[anki:play:q:0]	O contador de histórias começou sua história.
“Once upon a time a certain king seized all the corn in his country,[anki:play:q:0]	“Uma vez (era uma vez) um certo rei confiscou todo o milho de seu país,
and stored it in a strong granary,[anki:play:q:0]	e guardou-o em um forte celeiro,
but a swarm of locusts came over the land[anki:play:q:0]	mas um enxame de gafanhotos invadiu a terra
and saw where the grains were stored.[anki:play:q:0]	e viu onde os grãos estavam guardados.
After searching for many days,[anki:play:q:0]	Depois de procurar por muitos dias,
the locusts found a small crack on the east side of the granary,[anki:play:q:0]	os gafanhotos encontraram uma pequena rachadura no lado leste do celeiro,
but the opening was just large enough for one locust at a time to pass through.[anki:play:q:0]	mas a abertura era apenas grande o bastante para um gafanhoto de cada vez passar.
So, one locust went in[anki:play:q:0]	Então, um gafanhoto entrou
and carried away a grain of corn;[anki:play:q:0]	e levou um grão de milho;
then another locust went in[anki:play:q:0]	então outro gafanhoto entrou
and carried away a grain of corn;[anki:play:q:0]	e levou um grão de milho;
then another locust went in[anki:play:q:0]	então outro gafanhoto entrou
and carried away a grain of corn.”[anki:play:q:0]	e levou um grão de milho.”
Day after day, week after week,[anki:play:q:0]	Dia após dia, semana após semana,
the Stranger kept on saying,[anki:play:q:0]	o Estranho continuava dizendo,
“Then another locust went in and carried away a grain of corn.”[anki:play:q:0]	“Então outro gafanhoto entrou e levou um grão de milho.”
A month passed. A year passed.[anki:play:q:0]	Um mês se passou. Um ano se passou.
After two years, The King asked,[anki:play:q:0]	Depois de dois anos, o Rei perguntou,
“How much longer will the locusts be going in[anki:play:q:0]	“Por quanto tempo mais os gafanhotos vão entrar
"and carrying away corn?""[anki:play:q:0]"	e levar milho?”
"""Oh, King!"" said the Stranger,[anki:play:q:0]"	“Ó, Rei!” disse o Estranho,
“the locusts have only cleared a few inches,[anki:play:q:0]	“os gafanhotos removeram/liberaram apenas algumas polegadas,
"and there are thousands of inches in the granary.""[anki:play:q:0]"	e há milhares de polegadas no celeiro.”
“Man, man!” cried The King,[anki:play:q:0]	“Cara, cara!” gritou o Rei,
“You will drive me mad.[anki:play:q:0]	“Você vai me enlouquecer.
I can listen to it no longer.[anki:play:q:0]	Eu não posso mais escutar isso.
Take my daughter, be my heir, and rule my Kingdom,[anki:play:q:0]	Leve minha filha, seja meu herdeiro e reine sobre meu Reino,
but do not let me hear another word[anki:play:q:0]	mas não me deixe ouvir outra palavra
"about those incessant locusts!""[anki:play:q:0]"	sobre aqueles gafanhotos intermináveis!”
So, the Stranger married The King's daughter[anki:play:q:0]	Então, o Estranho se casou com a filha do Rei
and lived happily in the land for many years;[anki:play:q:0]	e viveu feliz naquela terra por muitos anos;
however, his father-in-law, The King,[anki:play:q:0]	no entanto, seu sogro, o Rei,
did not care to listen to any more stories.[anki:play:q:0]	não queria mais ouvir quaisquer outras histórias.
Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack.[anki:play:q:0]	Há muito tempo existia uma pobre viúva e seu filho Jack.

"Jack asked, ""What will you give me in return for my cow?""[anki:play:q:0]"	"Jack perguntou: ""O que você vai me dar em troca da minha vaca?""."

Jack took the magic beans[anki:play:q:0]	Jack pegou os feijões mágicos
and gave the man the cow.[anki:play:q:0]	e deu ao homem a vaca.
But when he reached home,[anki:play:q:0]	Mas quando ele chegou em casa,

"She said, ""You fool! He took away your cow""[anki:play:q:0]"	"Ela disse: ""Seu tolo! Ele levou embora sua vaca"""
"""and gave you some beans!""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""e deu a você alguns feijões!""."
She threw the beans out of the window.[anki:play:q:0]	Ela jogou os feijões pela janela.
Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.[anki:play:q:0]	Jack estava muito triste e foi dormir sem jantar.
The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning[anki:play:q:0]	No dia seguinte, quando Jack acordou de manhã

he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans![anki:play:q:0]	ele viu que um enorme pé de feijão tinha crescido de seus feijões mágicos!
He climbed up the beanstalk[anki:play:q:0]	Ele escalou o pé de feijão
and reached a kingdom in the sky.[anki:play:q:0]	e chegou a um reino no céu.
There lived a giant and his wife.[anki:play:q:0]	Lá viviam um gigante e sua esposa.
Jack went inside the house[anki:play:q:0]	Jack foi para dentro da casa
and found the giant’s wife in the kitchen.[anki:play:q:0]	e encontrou a esposa do gigante na cozinha.

The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.[anki:play:q:0]	A gentil esposa deu a ele pão e um pouco de leite.

"""Dead or alive, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!"",[anki:play:q:0]"	"""Vivo ou morto, eu vou moer os ossos dele para fazer meu pão!"","
"but the wife said, ""There is no boy in here!""[anki:play:q:0]"	"mas a mulher disse: ""Não tem nenhum menino aqui dentro!""."

He took out his sacks of gold coins,[anki:play:q:0]	Ele pegou seus sacos de moedas de ouro,

were created by the dangerous and intelligent mind of Daedalus,[anki:play:q:0]	foram criados pela perigosa e inteligente mente de Dédalo,
an artist of design and construction.[anki:play:q:0]	um artista do design e da construção.
Daedalus was so brilliant that King Minos of Crete kept him as a prisoner.[anki:play:q:0]	Dédalo era tão brilhante que o rei Minos de Creta o mantinha como um prisioneiro.
Daedalus lived with his son Icarus in a tower of the palace,[anki:play:q:0]	Dédalo vivia com seu filho Ícaro em uma torre do palácio,
and King Minos made him build tremendous weapons of war.[anki:play:q:0]	e o rei Minos o fez construir tremendas armas de guerra.
Although Daedalus and Icarus had a very comfortable life in the tower of the palace,[anki:play:q:0]	Embora Dédalo e Ícaro tivessem uma vida muito confortável na torre do palácio,
the father wished to return home to Athens.[anki:play:q:0]	o pai desejava retornar para casa em Atenas.
His son hardly remembered Athens,[anki:play:q:0]	Seu filho mal se lembrava de Atenas,
but he dreamed of running and playing in the open.[anki:play:q:0]	mas ele sonhava em correr e brincar ao ar livre.
Daedalus looked at the waves of the Mediterranean Sea,[anki:play:q:0]	Dédalo olhou para as ondas do Mar Mediterrâneo,
and realized that[anki:play:q:0]	e percebeu que
even if they could manage to escape from the tower and find a little boat,[anki:play:q:0]	mesmo se eles conseguissem dar um jeito de escapar da torre e encontrar um pequeno barco,
they wouldn’t get very far[anki:play:q:0]	eles não chegariam muito longe
before they were caught by one of the ships of King Minos’ navy.[anki:play:q:0]	antes que eles fossem pegos por um dos navios da marinha do rei Minos.
He thought for a long time about the best way to escape,[anki:play:q:0]	Ele pensou por um longo tempo sobre a melhor forma de escapar,
and finally, he came up with a plan.[anki:play:q:0]	e, finalmente, ele inventou um plano.
He told King Minos that he needed feathers and wax for a new project.[anki:play:q:0]	Ele disse ao rei Minos que ele precisava de penas e cera para um novo projeto.
After Daedalus received the feathers,[anki:play:q:0]	Depois que Dédalo recebeu as penas,
he took them to the roof of the tower,[anki:play:q:0]	ele as levou para o telhado da torre,
and placed the feathers into four lines.[anki:play:q:0]	e colocou as penas em quatro linhas.
He organized the feathers from shortest to longest[anki:play:q:0]	Ele organizou as penas da mais curta à mais comprida
until the feathers formed gentle half-moon shapes.[anki:play:q:0]	até que as penas formassem suaves/delicadas formas de meia-lua.
Then, Daedalus stuck the feathers together[anki:play:q:0]	Então, Dédalo prendeu as penas juntas
with string in the middle and wax at the base.[anki:play:q:0]	com barbante no meio e cera na base.
While Daedalus worked,[anki:play:q:0]	Enquanto Dédalo trabalhava,
Icarus played with the wax,[anki:play:q:0]	Ícaro brincava com a cera,
making it flat between his fingers,[anki:play:q:0]	achatando-a entre seus dedos,
and he chased feathers that floated on the wind.[anki:play:q:0]	e ele perseguia as penas que flutuavam ao vento.
Daedalus showed Icarus how he had made the feathers into two pair of wings.[anki:play:q:0]	Dédalo mostrou a Ícaro como ele havia transformado as penas em dois pares de asas.
He put the larger pair onto his arms,[anki:play:q:0]	Ele colocou o par maior em seus braços,
and began to quickly move them up and down[anki:play:q:0]	e começou rapidamente a movê-los para cima e para baixo
until his feet took off from the floor,[anki:play:q:0]	até que seus pés decolassem/saissem do chão,
and he seemed to stand in the sky.[anki:play:q:0]	e ele parecia estar parado no céu.
Icarus laughed and could not wait to try out the smaller pair of wings.[anki:play:q:0]	Ícaro riu e não podia esperar para experimentar o par de asas menor.
Over the next few days,[anki:play:q:0]	Ao longo dos dias seguintes,
father and son both exercised the wings[anki:play:q:0]	pai e filho ambos exercitaram suas asas
until little Icarus was almost as good at flying as his father.[anki:play:q:0]	até que o pequeno Ícaro estava quase tão bom em voar quanto seu pai.
Then one morning Daedalus said,[anki:play:q:0]	Então uma manhã Dédalo disse,
Now son, we are ready to leave this island for good.[anki:play:q:0]	Agora filho, nós estamos prontos para deixar esta ilha para sempre.
We shall fly home to Athens.[anki:play:q:0]	Nós vamos voar para casa em Atenas.
Flying is beautiful, but it can be very dangerous.[anki:play:q:0]	Voar é bonito, mas pode ser muito perigoso.
Listen to my instructions[anki:play:q:0]	Ouça minhas instruções
and be sure to obey them perfectly.[anki:play:q:0]	e certifique-se de obedecê-las perfeitamente.
At all times, follow me.[anki:play:q:0]	Em todos os momentos, siga-me,
Do not take a different flight path,[anki:play:q:0]	não tome uma rota de voo diferente,
or you will soon be lost.[anki:play:q:0]	ou você logo estará perdido.
Do not fly too low or your wings will get wet from the waves,[anki:play:q:0]	Não voe muito baixo ou suas asas ficarão molhadas com as ondas,
become too heavy, and drown you.[anki:play:q:0]	se tornarão pesadas demais, e te afogarão.
Nor should you fly too high,[anki:play:q:0]	Nem deve você voar muito alto,
or the sun will melt the wax, and your wings will fall apart.[anki:play:q:0]	ou o sol derreterá a cera, e suas asas se despedaçarão.
Have you understood all that I have said?[anki:play:q:0]	Você entendeu tudo o que eu disse?
Little Icarus nodded his understanding.[anki:play:q:0]	O pequeno Ícaro assentiu com a cabeça para mostrar seu entendimento.
Then Daedalus took his son to the highest walls of the tower[anki:play:q:0]	Então Dédalo levou seu filho para as mais altas muralhas da torre
and jumped into the sky, flapping his wings.[anki:play:q:0]	e pulou para o céu, batendo suas asas.
Icarus followed soon after.[anki:play:q:0]	Ícaro seguiu logo depois.
If a fisherman had looked up just then,[anki:play:q:0]	Se um pescador tivesse olhado para cima bem naquele momento,
he would have thought that he saw two Ancient Spirits with the arms of birds.[anki:play:q:0]	ele teria pensado que ele viu dois Espíritos Antigos com braços de pássaros.

Over the seas,[anki:play:q:0]	Sobre os mares,
they moved through the sky,[anki:play:q:0]	eles se moviam através do céu,
and at first Icarus felt afraid,[anki:play:q:0]	e no começo Ícaro sentiu medo,
for he had never gone very far in his practice flights,[anki:play:q:0]	pois ele tinha nunca ido muito longe em seus voos de prática,
but soon he found that flying was the most fun you could ever have.[anki:play:q:0]	mas logo ele descobriu que voar era a maior diversão que você poderia jamais ter.
He began to follow the sea birds,[anki:play:q:0]	Ele começou a seguir as aves marinhas,
dancing up and down above the ocean.[anki:play:q:0]	dançando para cima e para baixo sobre o oceano.
"His father turned around and called, ""Icarus, take care!"",[anki:play:q:0]"	"Seu pai virou para trás e gritou, ""Ícaro, tome cuidado!"","
and for a while Icarus flew carefully, like his father.[anki:play:q:0]	e por algum tempo Ícaro voou cuidadosamente, como seu pai.
But then his wings caught a warm air current,[anki:play:q:0]	Mas então suas asas apanharam uma corrente de ar quente,
and he found that he could move easily above and beyond with little effort.[anki:play:q:0]	e ele descobriu que ele conseguia se mover facilmente para além dos limites com pouco esforço.
This was the life![anki:play:q:0]	Isso sim que era vida!
Alternating between genius and bad puns.[anki:play:q:0]	A alternar entre o génio e maus trocadilhos.
This is no time for puns![anki:play:q:0]	Não é hora para piadas!
He was flying so high that the ships down below looked like tiny insects.[anki:play:q:0]	Ele estava voando tão alto que os navios lá embaixo pareciam insetos minúsculos.
His father called up to him,[anki:play:q:0]	Seu pai gritou para ele,
"""Icarus, remember what I told you. Come down right now!""[anki:play:q:0]"	"""Ícaro, lembre-se do que eu te disse. Desça agora mesmo!"""
Icarus could not hear him, however,[anki:play:q:0]	Ícaro não conseguia ouvi-lo, contudo,
and his father could not reach him.[anki:play:q:0]	e seu pai não conseguia alcançá-lo.
Icarus was far too close to the sun,[anki:play:q:0]	Ícaro estava muito/demais perto do sol,
and soon the wax that held the feathers together began to melt.[anki:play:q:0]	e logo a cera que mantinha as penas unidas começou a derreter.
Gradually his wings began to lose their shape,[anki:play:q:0]	Gradualmente, suas asas começaram a perder sua forma,
and some of the feathers even fell off.[anki:play:q:0]	e algumas das penas até caíram.
Icarus quickly moved his arms with worry and frenzy,[anki:play:q:0]	Ícaro rapidamente moveu seus braços com preocupação e furor,
but it was too late.[anki:play:q:0]	mas era tarde demais.
He had lost the power of flight,[anki:play:q:0]	Ele tinha perdido o poder do voo,
and down he fell with force into the sea.[anki:play:q:0]	e (para baixo) ele caiu com força para dentro do mar.
In the old Italian town of Atri,[anki:play:q:0]	Na antiga cidade italiana de Atri,

passed by the house and peeped in the keyhole,[anki:play:q:0]	passou pela casa e espiou pelo buraco da fechadura,
for she was not at all a polite, well-behaved little girl.[anki:play:q:0]	pois ela não era nem um pouco/de jeito nenhum uma garotinha educada e bem comportada.

Unfortunately, Goldilocks was insolent and rude,[anki:play:q:0]	Infelizmente, Cachinhos Dourados era insolente e rude,
